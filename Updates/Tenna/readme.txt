This is the ghost/uakagaka of "Ant" Tenna, based on a video game Deltarune.

!!Contains SPOILERS for Deltarune chapter 3!!

Tenna is an old TV that came to live, and it's been a long time since someone has watched him. Now that he's in your possession, that excitement is aimed at you!

You can:

- Keep him on your screen! He's just happy to be around.
- Watch things together! From videos to art, from listening to music to homework, he'll keep you company!
- Watch television! Tenna comes bundled with 3 channels, because that's how TV's were once upon a time.
- Tell him you love TV and boost his ego!
- Rub your hand on his face! (stroke your cursor over his screen)

!! Might be OOC, the creator is nowhere near as funny or witty as Toby Fox. !!
